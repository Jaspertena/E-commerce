# E-Commerce Back End 

Every online store needs an easy-to-manage inventory back-end setup. Whether the site owner needs to track their inventory, update or delete, this back-end setup can accommodate it all.  The Express API along with Insomnia allows the business owner to validate the products in the inventory database. The stakeholders can delete and update information as necessary even before the front-end interface is complete.
